# Loan Approval Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive model using a neural network to determine the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant data.

## Project Overview

The model is built using Python and Keras, and follows a full machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Neural Network Construction**
5. **Model Training and Validation**
6. **Evaluation and Result Interpretation**

## Aim

To build a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying loan applications as approved or denied based on input features.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Analyze trends and visualize feature relationships.
- Prepare and encode data.
- Design and train a neural network using Keras.
- Evaluate the model using key performance metrics.

## Results

The final trained model produced the following results:

- **Training Accuracy:** 98.75%
- **Training Loss:** 0.0385
- **Validation Accuracy:** 98.14%
- **Validation Loss:** 0.0552

These results demonstrate strong model performance and generalization with minimal overfitting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
## Datasets
 - The datasets used in this project are provided along with the project files on GitHub called UniversalBank.csv
